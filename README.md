# Molecular-Dinamic-Simulation
This proyect implements a **Velocity Verlet integrator** to simulate the dinamics of particles in a **harmonic trap** with **short-range interactions** . The system consists of **soft-core spheres**, and the simulation evolves their positions and velocities in one dimension.
